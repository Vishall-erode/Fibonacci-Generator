# Fibonacci-Generator
Introduction
The Fibonacci sequence is a set of numbers whereby each number is the sum of the two numbers before it. Normally, this sequence starts at 0 and 1. This project explains how to develop a Fibonacci number generator with Verilog. The module sequentially outputs Fibonacci numbers on every clock cycle and has parameterized bits for different widths.

Features
It generates the Fibonacci numbers sequentially.
It parameterizes the bit width to cover different ranges.
It supports a reset function so that the user can restart the sequence.
Designed for FPGA or ASIC implementations.
Usage
Prerequisites
To use this project, you'll need:
 

A Verilog simulator such as ModelSim, Xilinx Vivado, or Synopsys VCS.
